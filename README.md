# Janus

![Janus login page](/documentation/login.png)

An Application/Product Lifecycle Management solution handling products with regards to user needs, requirements, issues, teams, backlogs and releases for development, building and maintaining products and services, focusing on their entire life cycle.

**_NOTE:_** From **wikipedia**: In ancient Roman religion and myth, Janus (/ˈdʒeɪnəs/ JAY-nəs; Latin: Ianus [ˈi̯aːnʊs]) is the god of beginnings, gates, transitions, time, duality, doorways, passages, frames, and endings.

It will contain support for teams, product owners and single individuals tasks to maintain the product or service.

## Status
The project is in an early design and startup phase. It started 2023-01-10 and is currently creating the code framework for the solution so I can start build on functionality. It uses a lot of structuring, functions and ideas from Thomas Honeymans ![Real World Halogen](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-realworld).


It is just the rest of the application left ;-)
